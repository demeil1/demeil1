## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Demeil.

I am a 20 year old Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Chicago ðŸŒ±. Ever since I was young, I had an interest in computers and programming. Some of my fondest memories include attempting to build my own computer and trying to write code on my family computer.

My passions include backend and low level development âš¡. In my free time, I enjoy solving coding problems and furthering my education in fields like mathematics ðŸ”­. Additionally, I have a love for low level software like operating systems.

I strive to become a better programmer by writing code for problems that I, and others, want solutions too ðŸ¤”. Other than that, I enjoy reviewing code written by others to help hone my skills ðŸ˜„.
