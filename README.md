## Hi 👋, I'm Demeil.

I am an Electrical Engineering major at the University of Illinois at Chicago, with a focus on Digital Systems and VLSI ⚡. My background is a unique blend, as my degree is in EE, but I have taken nearly the entire Computer Science curriculum to understand the "Silicon-to-Software" stack as well as possible. I am currently preparing for my Master's in EE to take my knowledge to the next level.

I have always been fascinated by how computers operate at the atomic level, from designing my first PCs to writing my first lines of code.

What I'm Working On:
🔌 Hardware Design: CPU/GPU/ASIC Architecture, SystemVerilog, and RTL-to-GDSII.

💻 Low-Level Systems: Operating Systems, Kernel development, and C/Rust.

🏎️ Performance: High concurrency systems and hardware-accelerated computing.

I spend my free time watching videos about complex problems in computer architecture, reading up on advancements in microarchitecture, and exploring unusual operating systems 🔭. I am always willing to collaborate on low-level systems or review interesting hardware designs. If it has something to do with registers, logic gates, or pointers, then I am interested. 🤔😄
