## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Demeil.

I am a 20 year old Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Chicago ðŸŒ±. My passions include backend and low level development âš¡. In my free time, I enjoy solving coding problems and furthering my education in fields like mathematics ðŸ”­.

I strive to become a better programmer by aiming to put out code for problems that I, and others, want solutions too ðŸ¤”. Furthermore, I am not afraid to point out my own missteps when trying to improve ðŸ˜„.

Languages and Frameworks:
c cplusplus python rust git sql
